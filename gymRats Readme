This document serves as a reference manual for the GymRats game

GymRats is a text-based adventure game set in the gym of the same name. The game uses the code found at [INSTERT LINK] and features are 
built upon this "engine". This project began as an assignment for a Software Engineering module during my MSc course. It also serves as a 
sample project in order to learn how to use github (at last)
